Overview -
ECG2o represents the culmination of our Bachelor’s capstone project, developed by a team of four under the expert mentorship of Professor. This project is dedicated to advancing electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing by employing state-of-the-art noise suppression, feature extraction, and classification techniques. Designed with both clinical accuracy and real-time applicability in mind, ECG2o aspires to contribute meaningfully to cardiac diagnostics and patient monitoring.



Background & Motivation - In an era where cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality, precise ECG analysis is paramount. ECG2o was conceived to bridge the gap between theoretical signal processing and practical, deployable diagnostic tools. Our system harnesses advanced digital filtering and machine learning algorithms to enhance the detection of arrhythmias and other cardiac irregularities. This project not only deepened our technical expertise but also underscored the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration in solving real-world healthcare challenges.



Technical Architecture -
1.Signal Acquisition: High-fidelity electrodes capture raw ECG data, which is then digitized through a custom-designed hardware interface.
2.Preprocessing Pipeline: The raw signals are processed using advanced digital filtering techniques and wavelet transforms to mitigate noise and baseline wander.
3.Feature Extraction: Both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses are performed to isolate critical ECG features, including the PQRST complex, R-peak detection, and heart rate variability metrics.
4.Classification & Analysis: Machine learning classifiers are employed to identify and categorize arrhythmias, ensuring a robust, scalable solution.
5.Real-Time Monitoring: An integrated module enables real-time signal analysis, making ECG2o suitable for both laboratory and potential clinical environments.



Key Features -
1.Robust Noise Suppression: Utilizes sophisticated filtering and wavelet-based techniques to ensure signal integrity.
2.Automated Feature Extraction: Accurately identifies key ECG components, enabling reliable heart rate and rhythm analysis.
3.Intelligent Classification: Implements machine learning algorithms to discern and classify various arrhythmias.
4.Modular Architecture: Designed for scalability and future integration with portable or wearable diagnostic devices.
5.Real-Time Processing: Provides instantaneous feedback, making it ideal for continuous monitoring applications.



Implementation Details -
1.Programming Environment: Developed using Python and MATLAB, leveraging libraries for digital signal processing and machine learning.
2.System Integration: Combines offline batch processing with real-time analysis, ensuring both precision and responsiveness.
3.Validation: Extensively tested using benchmark ECG datasets, with performance metrics validated against established clinical standards.
