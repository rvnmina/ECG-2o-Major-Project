ECG2o is an innovative project developed by a team of four under the mentorship of Professor [Teacher’s Name]. It is designed to revolutionize cardiac diagnostics by integrating cutting-edge digital signal processing techniques, robust machine learning algorithms, and real-time cloud connectivity. This system processes raw ECG data acquired from an Arduino-ESP8266 module, enabling precise detection and classification of arrhythmic events.


**Project Overview**

**Raw Data Acquisition**: The heart of ECG2o lies in capturing high-fidelity raw ECG signals using an Arduino-ESP8266 platform. This hardware setup enables wireless transmission of the raw data, providing a reliable foundation for subsequent processing steps.

**Advanced Signal Processing**: The acquired data undergoes sophisticated noise suppression and signal enhancement techniques—including digital filtering and wavelet transforms—to isolate critical features such as the QRS complex and R-peaks.

**Machine Learning Integration**: Extracted features are analyzed with advanced machine learning classifiers to detect and categorize arrhythmias with high accuracy.

**Real-Time Visualization**: Processed data is transmitted to a Firebase cloud backend and displayed on an interactive React.js dashboard, ensuring clinicians have immediate access to actionable diagnostic information.
