![ECG2o Banner](./images/banner.png)

**Overview**
**ECG2o** represents the culmination of our Bachelor’s capstone project. Developed by a team of four under the expert mentorship of Professor [Teacher’s Name], this project advances electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing through state‑of‑the‑art noise suppression, feature extraction, and classification techniques. Designed with both clinical accuracy and real‑time applicability in mind, ECG2o aspires to contribute meaningfully to cardiac diagnostics and patient monitoring.



**Background & Motivation**
Cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Precise ECG analysis is therefore paramount. ECG2o was conceived to bridge the gap between theoretical signal processing and practical, deployable diagnostic tools. The system harnesses advanced digital filtering and machine learning algorithms to enhance the detection of arrhythmias and other cardiac irregularities. This project not only deepened our technical expertise but also underscored the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in solving real-world healthcare challenges.



**Technical Architecture**
The ECG2o system is built upon a modular design comprising the following components:

1. **Signal Acquisition**  
   High-fidelity electrodes capture raw ECG data, which is then digitized through a custom-designed hardware interface.

2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**  
   Raw signals are processed using advanced digital filtering techniques and wavelet transforms to mitigate noise and baseline wander.

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   Both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses isolate critical ECG features—such as the PQRST complex, R-peak detection, and heart rate variability metrics.

4. **Classification & Analysis**  
   Machine learning classifiers are employed to identify and categorize arrhythmias, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

5. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   An integrated module enables real-time signal analysis, making ECG2o suitable for both laboratory and potential clinical environments.
